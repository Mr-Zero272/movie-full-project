  "description": "20-year old Hadley Sullivan misses her flight to London to attend her father’s wedding and is re-booked on the next flight. While waiting at the gate, she meets British 22-year old Yale mathematics student Oliver Jones who offers to lend her his charger when noticing hers is dead. The two get along and eat together; seeing Oliver carrying a garment bag, she assumes he is also going to attend a wedding and he does not contest this. When Oliver’s seat belt is broken, the flight attendant seats him next to Hadley. The two spend the flight talking and growing close. Hadley shares that her dad and her were very close prior to him moving to London to teach poetry and eventually divorcing her mother, leading her to be hesitant to attend his wedding and forgive him. Oliver encourages Hadley to do so. The two share a moment and nearly kiss while waiting for the bathroom before falling asleep for the remaining duration of the flight.",
