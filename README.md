This is a personal project of mine with the purpose of practicing what I have learned.
The project includes the following parts:
- ADMIN/BUSINESS UI.
- USER UI.
- Microservices (Back-end following microservices architecture)
- Database (I will update it when the project is complete)
To be able to run this project you need some setup first:
- First is the kafka server local (refer here https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)
- Next is the Redis server (refer here: https://redis.io/)
- Install react libraries first with the command npm i.
- Run the project by launching the Kafka server, then the Redis server, the back-end components of the project, and finally the front-end.
